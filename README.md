# data-science-projects
My first hands-on Data Science projects using Python, covering data visualization, sales prediction with Linear Regression, and student pass/fail prediction using Logistic Regression.
📌 Projects Included

1. Student Marks Analysis (Bar Chart)
- Visualized student performance using a bar chart
- Dataset: student_marks.csv
